1. Open the "final" folder
2. Double-click the file named "index.html"
3. Input all necessary information
4. Click "Create Flyer" at the bottom
5. Check that all information is correct
6. Click the black printer button at the bottom right
7. Save to PDF, or print directly

Note that the information is not saved after the "Create flyer" button is clicked. I recommend saving/writing the information down somewhere else and then copying/pasting it into each box.
